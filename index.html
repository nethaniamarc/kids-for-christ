                <summary>What is Kids for Christ?</summary>
                <p>Great question! It's an organization that started over 20 years
                    at New Jerusalem Evangelical Church and seeks to teach children
                    about the bible through lessons and games.</p>

                <summary>Is there an in-person meet-up?</summary>
                <p>Absolutely! The lessons will be explored further in a weekly bible study at New Jerusalem Evangelical
                    Baptist Church.

                <summary>Who are the lessons for?</summary>
                <p>For children of all ages. They are divided in elementary, middle, and high school to fit the
                    biblical knowledge that students may have at certain ages.
                    But if the content is too easy or too hard, feel free to adjust by going up or down a school level.

                <summary>What if I fall behind on the lessons?</summary>
                <p>That's Ok! We understand that life can be hectic. Feel free to work at your own pace.
                    Note however, that the in-person meetings follow a weekly schedule.</p>

                <summary>How can I help my student with the lessons?</summary>
                <p>Before beginning a lesson, read the scripture prior to prime your child for what they will learn.
                    And, since each lesson should be completed in a week, take the week to read through (and maybe even
                    re-read) challenging materials.</p>

                <p>You may find the schedule located in the Schedule section.
                    It should project all future meetings for the school year.</p>
